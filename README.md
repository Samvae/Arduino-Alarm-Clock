## Project Overview
### - Problem Statement:<br> Smartphones have timers, but you risk going on your phone and getting distracted while studying. This timer will keep you on track and alert you when the time is up.
### - Product:<br> A box that acts as an alarm/timer and clock. The user sets a time, and the timer counts it down. A buzzer goes off when it reaches 0:00, and the time is displayed on an OLED screen.

## Install and use Arduino IDE environment.
<b> Optional: Use EAGLE Schematic
